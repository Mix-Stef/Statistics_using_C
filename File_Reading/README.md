Hash_table.c and hash_table.h are a basic implementation of a hash table. We use it to count the frequency of categorical variables.

Read_file.c is a script that reads a .csv file (with delimiter ","), counts the number of columns and rows as well as computes the sum, mean, max, min, variance and standard deviation of a given column. There are also two methods for calculating the frequency of categorical variables.

Random_normal.csv is a synthetic dataset made by the sample_normal.c script. Each column follows the standard normal distribution so we expect a mean of approximately 0 and variance 1 for each column.
