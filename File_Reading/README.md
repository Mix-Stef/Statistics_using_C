Read_file.c is a script that reads a .csv file (with delimiter ","), counts the number of columns as well as computes the sum, mean, max, min, variance and standard deviation of a given column. 

Random_normal.csv is a synthetic dataset made by the sample_normal.c script. Each column follows the standard normal distribution so we expect a mean of approximately 0 and variance 1 for each column.
