* Box-Muller Transform: It is a sample method for generating independent, normally distributed  random numbers. The source of the randomness is a pair of independent samples, $U_1$ and $U_2$, chosen from the uniform distribution on (0, 1). It can be proven that the numbers $$Z_0 = \sqrt{-2 \ln U_1} \cos(2\pi U_2)$$ and $$Z_1 = \sqrt{-2 \ln U_1} \sin(2\pi U_2)$$ is a pair of independent random variables with a standard normal distribution.
